Major difference between MySQL and PostgreSQL:
- Queries with placeholder '?' in MySQL requires placeholders like "$1", '$2' in PostgresSQL
- in PostgreSQL fetchNextRow must always be called until EOF. If not, PostGreSQL reports fatal errors.
- The function ST_AsBinary requires an explicit type cast in PostgreSQL: ST_AsBinary(rectangle::geometry)
