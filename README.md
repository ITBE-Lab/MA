## Getting Started

There are three options to get MA running:

#### 1. The Installer

An installer is available on the It-Be homepage: 

http://itbe.hanyang.ac.kr/research-articles/alignment/

Note: The installer is currently the only way to obtain the GUI version of MA.

#### 2. Cloning & Compiling
This software uses boost 1.65. And python 3.

@todo make the Makefile nicer...
After installing boost and python, set $(BOOST_ROOT) and $(PYTHON_ROOT) 
then execute following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/ItBeLab/ma
    cd ma
    make
    ./ma -h

#### 3. Pip

coming soon!
